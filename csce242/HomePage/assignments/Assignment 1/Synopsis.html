           The world ends with you is a Nintendo Game originally released in the Summer of 2007 for the Nintendo DS.
           This MASTERPIECE of a game just so happens to my favorite game of all time, and I'm happy to make three different websites about it!
           First, let's begin with the main plot of the story.
           This game focuses around a group of teenagers battling to survive the Reaper's Game, a mad scramble throughout the streets of Shibuya that lasts seven full days.
           The main cast featured on the right, are the players that you control throughout the game and the remaining characters on the left are some of the aforementioned reapers that you encounter.
