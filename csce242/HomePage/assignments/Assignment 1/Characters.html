        <p> On this page, I hope to shed some light on the playable characters within the game.
            Starting on the left and moving to the right, the main playable character in the game is a 15 year old boy named Neku Sakuraba.
            Neku is an asocial teen who goes purposely out of his way to avoid talking to other people due to the fact that he believes that nobody else's opinion matters but his own. 
            This all begins to change once he meets his first game partner in the game and second playable character Shiki Misaki. Shiki is also a 15 year old teen, and unlike her partner, loves
            talking to other players and tries to befriend Neku despite his constant insults to her. Following Shiki, Joshua is Neku's second partner in the game and is kind of a personal fan
            favorite, including me. Even though he is also just 15 years old, Joshua is clearly the wisest and smartest character in the game and his arrogant snobbish attitude definitely causes
            some internal turmoil within Neku as he struggles to get along with him throughout the second week. It's also heavily implied throughout the game that Joshua may have a thing for Neku,
            but it's never explicitly stated. Some of his teasing lines such as "Shut up and walk dear" and "Sounds like a fun time" in response to a line with heavy homoerotic subtext have
            caused many fans to ship him and Neku together. And finally the last character on the far right is our final 15 year old teen named Beat. Beat is a hot-headed character that quickly 
            jumps to conclusions and lives by the motto punch first ask questions later, and in a game where that mentality gets you killed, one can only imagine the dangerous scnarios he manages 
            to get his partners in in-game.
